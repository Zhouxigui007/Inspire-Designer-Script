RVector Methods
RVector methods are used on the Content tab of Scripted Areas to manipulate values for the position of Layout objects. They can also be used to position page-level objects via the Imposition Script module.

RVector is defined in Double, Vector in Int coordinates.

Tip  In Inspire Designer, these methods use meter (m) as a default measurement unit. You can use the Math Methods to convert the parameters to meters or to convert the results to required units. e.g. frommm converts a parameter from milimeters to meters and tomm converts the result from meters to milimeters.

AngleInDegrees / AngleInRadians
AngleInDegrees : Double
getAngleInDegrees () : Double
AngleInRadians : Double
getAngleInRadians () : Double
Gets the vector angle in the degrees/radians measurement units.

Scripting API | RVector Methods
Area
Area : Double
Multiplies X and Y.

Example  
RVector r;
r.assign(0.5,1.0);
logMessage(r.Area.toString());

assign
assign (Double aP1, Double aP2) : Void
assign (RVector aP1) : Void
assign (Vector aP1) : Void
Assigns values to a vector. Same as the = assignment statement.

Scripting API | RVector Methods
ceilToVector
ceilToVector : Vector
Rounds up to Int numbers (RVector changes to Vector).

Example  
RVector r;
r.assign(0.6,1.4);
r.ceilToVector(); //rounds to 1,2
Scripting API | RVector Methods
floorToVector
floorToVector : Vector
Rounds down to Int numbers (RVector changes to Vector).

Example  
RVector r;
r.assign(0.6,1.4);
r.floorToVector(); //rounds to 0,1

isNull
isNull () : Bool
If True is returned, RVector is not initialized (does not overwrite memory).

Scripting API | RVector Methods
Length
Length () : Double
getLength () : Double
Gets the length of RVector.

Scripting API | RVector Methods
ManhattanLength
ManhattanLength : Double
getManhattanLength () : Double
Gets Manhattan length (X+Y).

The "Manhattan Length" of a route between two points is the distance that the tracks would total if they run only in the x or y directions. So if we have two points, A(X1, Y1) and B(X2, Y2), the Manhattan length between the two points is the sum of the absolute values of (X2-X1) and (Y2-Y1).

Scripting API | RVector Methods
normalize
normalize () : RVector
Makes the vector length equal to 1.

Scripting API | RVector Methods
roundToVector
roundToVector () : Vector
Rounds to the nearest integer (RVector changes to Vector).

Scripting API | RVector Methods
setX / setY
setX (Double aP1) : Void
setY (Double aP1) : Void
Sets X/Y value.

Scripting API | RVector Methods
SquareLength
SquareLength (Double aP1) : Double
getSquareLength () : Double
Gets square length of RVector.

Scripting API | RVector Methods
toString
toString () : String
Converts RVector into a string representation.

Scripting API | RVector Methods
transform
transform (Transformation aP1) : RVector
Applies a transformation on RVector.

Scripting API | RVector Methods
X / Y
X : Double
getX () : Double
Y : Double
getY () : Double
Gets X/Y value of RVector.

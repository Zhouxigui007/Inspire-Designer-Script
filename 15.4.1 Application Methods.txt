Application Methods
Application methods are static methods which call Inspire Designer to perform a task while the script is being processed, i.e. they do not manipulate the objects in the script but the application.

logWarning
logWarning(String aString) : Void
Writes the specified warning message to the application log, e.g. Log window-pane.

String strPrice = "$300";

   logWarning("The specified value could not be parsed. The value of zero will be used instead.");

pauseAfterCurrentSheet
pauseAfterCurrentSheet(String aString) : Void
Pauses the processing of the workflow during proof or production and writes the specified message to the log, e.g. Log window-pane. This method interrupts printing on IPDS printers, perhaps so that some manual check can be performed. It is only intended for use with the IPDS engine.

Example  If pausing of production on every 100th sheet is required, it can be accomplished using the new calculated Bool variable placed somewhere on the layout page. The code is:
if (SYS.GlobalSheetCounter % 100 == 0)
  {
    pauseAfterCurrentSheet('Paused. Current sheet is #' + SYS.GlobalSheetCounter.toString());
  }

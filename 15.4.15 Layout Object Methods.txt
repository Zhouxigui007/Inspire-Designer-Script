Layout Object Methods
Layout Object methods are used on the Content tab of Scripted Areas in order to define the design of the content of that area on a page by manipulating different Layout objects.

Tip  In Inspire Designer, these methods use meter (m) as a default measurement unit. You can use the Math Methods to convert the parameters to meters or to convert the results to required units. e.g. frommm converts a parameter from milimeters to meters and tomm converts the result from meters to millimeters.

BarcodeSize
BarcodeSize [Barcode aP1] : RVector
getBarcodeSize (Barcode aP1) : RVector
Returns the size of barcode.

draw
drawBarcode (Transformation aP1, Barcode aP2) : Bool
drawFlow(Transformation aP1, RVector aP2, Flow aP3) : Bool
drawFlowOnPath (Transformation aP1, Path aP2, Flow aP3) : Bool
drawImage (Transformation aP1, Image aP2) : Bool
drawPathObject (Transformation aP1, PathObject aP2) : Bool
Draws the specified barcode, fill style, flow, flow on path (text on curve), image or path object (shape) at the given position Transformation aP1. Returns True if drawing was successful, for drawFlow this means the flow sucessfully fitted the area described by RVector aP2.

Example  Defines a position vector and scale as a single transformation and draws an image after applying the transformation:
Transformation tr;
RVector ims = getRealImageSize(Logo);
RVector rs = RVector(frommm(30),frommm(30));
RVector ss = RVector(rs.X/ims.X,rs.Y/ims.Y);
tr.scale(ss);
drawImage(tr,Logo);
Defines a 30 degree rotation of a shape (path object):

Transformation tr;
tr.rotate(30);
drawPathObject(tr,MyShape);

FlowAreaDim
FlowAreaDim [FlowArea aP1] : RVector
getFlowAreaDim (FlowArea aP1) : RVector
Gets the real size of the specified flow area.

fromin / frommm / frompt
fromin (Double aP1) : Double
frommm (Double aP1) : Double
frompt (Double aP1) : Double
Converts measurement units from inches/millimeters/points to meters.

Scripting API | LayoutObject Methods
formatFlowTo
formatFlowTo (Path aP1, Flow aP2) : Bool
formatFlowTo (RVector aP1, Flow aP2) : RVector
formatFlowTo (RVector aP1, Flow aP2, Double & aFirstBaseLine) : RVector
Formats a flow into the scripted area. Returns Boolean value True (if flow formatting was successful); RVector size of flow; or RVector (baseline position of the first line of the text inside the formatted flow).

Example  This script places the first line 5cm from the baseline.
Double baseLine;
formatFlowTo(RVector(0.15,0.1), Flow_1, baseLine);
drawFlow(Transformation(RVector(0,0.05-baseLine)),RVector(0.15,0.1),Flow_1);

RealImageSize
RealImageSize [Image aP1] : RVector

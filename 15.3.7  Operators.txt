15.3.7  Operators
The script language supports:

Assignment operators - Assigns the value of the left operand (general expression) to the value of the right operand (variable or array element).

Arithmetic operators - Take operands of any numeric data type.

Comparison operators - Take operands of any data type with the data type result always boolean.

Boolean operators - Take Boolean operands and also resulting in a Boolean value.

The highest precedence operators are evaluated first. See the list ordered from the highest to lowest priority:

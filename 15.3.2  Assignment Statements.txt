15.3.2  Assignment Statements
An assignment statement assigns the value of the general expression on the right side to the variable or array element given on the left side.


Assignment Value	Description
=	
Assigns the value of the general expression on the right side to the variable or array element given on the left side, e.g. x = 5.

+=	
Adds the value of the general expression on the right side to the variable or array element given on the left side, i.e. i=i+2 is the same as i+=2.

-=	
Subtracts the value of the general expression on the right side from the variable or array element given on the left side, i.e. i=i-2 is the same as i-=2.

*=	
Multiplies the value of the general expression on the right side with the value of the variable or array element given on the left side, i.e. r=r*2.5 is the same as r*=2.5.

/=	
Divides the value of the variable or array element given on the left side by value of the general expression on the right side, i.e. r=r/3.14 is the same as r/=3.14.

%=	
Calculates value of modulus of a number with respect to a base value. The modulus is the remainder from dividing the number by the base value, i.e. year=year%400 is the same as year%=400.

|=	
Performs OR operation. a=a|b is the same as a|=b.

&=	
Performs AND operation. a=a&b is the same as a&=b.

^=	
Performs XOR operation. a=a^b is the same as a^=b.

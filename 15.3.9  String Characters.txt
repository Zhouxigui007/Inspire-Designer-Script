15.3.9  String Characters
You can specify special text characters in scripts (for example a non-printable character) using the following values. The value has to be enclosed in single quotes, e.g. '\r'.

Any Unicode character

\u####

E.g. \u20ac for € character

Backslash followed by u and Unicode hexadecimal value.

Any single-byte character

\x##

E.g. \xA9 for © character

Backslash followed by x and hexadecimal value.

Carriage return

\r

Inserts a Carriage Return character. Equals \x0D.

New line

\n

Inserts a Line Feed character. Equals \x0A.

Apostrophe

\'

Used for specifying an apostrophe character within the string enclosed in apostrophes. See example.

See also the Field separators option for the Data Input module.

15.3.9.1  Enclosing String Values
To specify a string value in script, it is necessary to enclose it:

in quotation marks, e.g. "sample string"

or in apostrophes, e.g. 'another sample string'

However, there are differences between handling strings enclosed in quotation marks and in apostrophes:

Strings enclosed in 'apostrophes' are checked for the presence of substitute characters (\n , \', \x## etc.) and these characters are processed, i.e. replaced by their equivalents.

Strings enclosed in "quotation marks" are not checked for presence of the substitute characters, i.e. the string is left as "it is".

To use apostrophe or quotation mark in the strings, follow these rules:

Use apostrophe in a string value enclosed in quotation marks: String s = "My father's car"

Use substitute character for apostrophe in a string value enclosed in apostrophes: String s = 'My father\'s car' or String s = 'Eva\'s book'

Use quotation mark apostrophe in a string value enclosed in apostrophes: String s = 'This is a quotation mark: "'

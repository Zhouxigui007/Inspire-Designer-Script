15.3.1  Syntax Overview
The syntax has several key characteristics:

It is case sensitive.

Statements have to be ended by a semicolon.

Anything on a line written after two slash characters // is considered a comment and not read into the script.

Declaring
In Designer, variables can be declared in two ways:

Explicitly - Variables are declared using their data-type.

For example, to declare a String variable, enter: String = VariableName. Then you can assign a value to the variable, e.g. VariableName = "Text".

Alternatively, you can declare and initialize the variable (assign it a value) at the same time. Using the previous examples, the two can be combined to: String VariableName = "Text".

Tip  As the syntax is case sensitive, you have to enter the data-type with correct capitalization. If entered correctly, the Script Editor will recognize it as such and the data-type will turn blue (if default Script Editor colors are used).
Implicitly - Variables are declared and initialized using the keyword var.

For example, to declare and initialize a String variable, enter: var VariableName = "Text". The data-type String is inferred by the compiler.

Note  You cannot declare an implicitly declared variable without initializing it. I.e. entering var = VariableName is going to result in a script error.
Tip  See the section Implicitly Typed Variables for additional information and examples.
